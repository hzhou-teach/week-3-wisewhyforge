Took some time to figure it out I had to search the question up to start from te end instead of the beginning, 
and then I got confused on the corner cases like "a " and " a", so I used the didWordHappen method to solve it.

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        //If just a space return 0
        if(s.equals(" "))
            return 0;
        //If nothing return nothing
        if(s.length() == 0)
            return 0;
        int current = 0;
        //Variable that stores whether or not a letter happened
        boolean didWordHappen = false;
        //Count down from the end and then once a letter has been found keep counting down until a space is found
        //if there is a space and no letter just keep on going down
        for(int i = s.length()-1; i >= 0; i--){
            //If this isn't a space then add to the count and set that a word happened
            if(s.charAt(i) != ' '){
                current++;
                //Since there is a word set it to true 
                didWordHappen = true;
            //This case is where there is a space and letters were used signifying a word
            //In this case we already have the word just break and return the length
            }else if(didWordHappen){
                break;
            }
